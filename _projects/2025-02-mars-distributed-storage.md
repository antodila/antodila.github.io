repo: https://github.com/antodila/mars-distributed-storage-system
---

Proof-of-concept of a **peer-to-peer**, fault-tolerant, highly available key-value store built in **Java (Akka Actors)**.  
Implements **consistent hashing**, **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** for atomic writes, and **quorum-based replication (R + W > N)** to guarantee sequential consistency.  
Includes **node crash/recovery simulation**, **data handoff**, and **read-repair**.
